Got your own plurk API key at http://www.plurk.com/API and fill into PlurkAPI.js and JetPlurk_lighting.js first.

For phoneGap usage, put index.html JetPlurk_lighting.js jquery.js json2.js & PlurkAPI.js inside www directory.

For Firefox Jetpack Prototype experiment, install firebug first, then install through Jetpack_Prototype_installer.html. This version still had the XHR problem not yet resolve, thus you will get "jsObject is null" error, and won't work properly.

Daily usage with Firefox JetPack Prototype, please try http://jetplurk.poslab.info/alpha fro instead.

If you want to try and helping migrating JetPlurk to Jetpack SDK framework, contact Irvin irvinfly(AT)gmail.com for commit privilege.
